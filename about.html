          <h1>About the Book</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Sleep Again</strong> is a comprehensive guide written specifically for entrepreneurs who have sacrificed their sleep in pursuit of building something meaningful—and are now ready to reclaim it.
          </p>

          <p>
            This isn't another generic sleep book telling you to avoid screens before bed. It's a deep dive into why entrepreneurs face unique sleep challenges and what actually works to overcome them.
          </p>

          <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>The Science Behind Your Sleeplessness</strong><br>
            Understand the hormonal symphony that governs sleep—from cortisol and melatonin to the circadian rhythms that your irregular schedule has disrupted. Learn why the entrepreneurial mindset that serves you during the day becomes your enemy at night.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Lifestyle Factors You Haven't Considered</strong><br>
            Beyond the obvious culprits, discover how over-training, attention span fragmentation, work trips, and even your relationships affect your sleep quality. Learn to find your optimal sleep strategy among competing priorities.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Mental Strategies That Actually Work</strong><br>
            Tackle the racing mind at 5 AM, manage stress and worry, and build a wind-down routine that prepares your brain for rest. Learn when to stay in bed and when to get up—and how to celebrate your sleep wins along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Your Personalized Sleep Toolkit</strong><br>
            From sleep tracking apps and temperature-controlled mattresses to masks, earplugs, and knowing when to see a specialist—build a toolkit tailored to your specific needs.
          </p>

          <h2>Who This Book Is For</h2>

          <p>
            This book is for entrepreneurs who:
          </p>

          <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Wake up at 3 AM with their mind racing about work</li>
            <li>Have tried "all the tips" but nothing sticks</li>
            <li>Feel guilty about needing rest when there's so much to do</li>
            <li>Want to perform at their best without burning out</li>
            <li>Are ready to treat sleep as a competitive advantage, not a necessary evil</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you've ever laid awake wondering how successful people seem to do it all while you can barely function after another sleepless night, this book will show you another path forward.
