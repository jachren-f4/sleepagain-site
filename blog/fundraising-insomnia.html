          <h1>Fundraising Insomnia: Why VCs Are Costing You Sleep</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 21, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>I've been on both sides of the fundraising table. Fifteen years as a VC-backed founder, then six years as an investor watching founders go through the same process I once went through. In all those years, across hundreds of conversations about pitch decks, term sheets, and runway projections, one thing was consistent: fundraising was the single worst sleep period in a founder's life.</p>

            <p>Not product launches. Not co-founder breakups. Not even running out of money. The act of raising capital itself was what destroyed sleep the most.</p>

            <h2>The Pattern I Kept Seeing</h2>

            <p>When I asked a dozen founders about their worst sleep periods, fundraising came up again and again. The descriptions were strikingly similar.</p>

            <p>One founder told me she would go to bed thinking about the raise, upcoming meetings, and pitch strategies, then wake up with those same thoughts still running. Her brain would cycle through every possible scenario, lingering on the worst ones. It felt like her mind never actually switched off.</p>

            <p>Another founder reported sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a night during a critical funding round. He would fall asleep quickly but wake around 2am and couldn't get back down. After three months of this pattern, he started medication. It eventually led to burnout and a month of medical leave.</p>

            <p>These weren't outliers. This was the norm.</p>

            <h2>The Cortisol-Runway Loop</h2>

            <p>The mechanism behind fundraising insomnia is straightforward. Financial uncertainty triggers cortisol. Cortisol keeps the brain alert. The brain cycles through scenarios because that's what it's designed to do under threat.</p>

            <p>In evolutionary terms, your brain doesn't know the difference between a predator and a collapsing runway. It responds to both the same way: stay awake, stay ready.</p>

            <p>What makes fundraising worse than other forms of financial stress is the duration. A product launch is stressful for a week. A fundraise can grind on for three to six months. You're calculating and recalculating the financial model. You're fighting doubt that comes from your own predictions of cashflow and product success. The cortisol never fully clears because the uncertainty never fully resolves.</p>

            <p>One founder I know described it as constantly fighting with himself, moving away the worries to function or diving deeper to clear them. Neither approach worked at 2am.</p>

            <h2>The Pitch Prep Spiral</h2>

            <p>There's a specific type of insomnia that only founders in a raise will recognize. You close your laptop at 11pm. You get into bed. And then your brain starts rehearsing.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow's pitch deck. The objection about unit economics. The question about why your competitor just raised a Series B. The answer you gave last week that wasn't sharp enough. The slide you should probably restructure before the morning meeting.</p>

            <p>This isn't regular work anxiety. It's preparation anxiety. Your brain treats the pitch like a performance, and it wants to rehearse. At 1am. At 3am. At 4:30am when the alarm is set for 6.</p>

            <p>The problem compounds because you can't pause a fundraise. Once you're in the process, there are investor meetings every day. Each meeting generates new thoughts, new angles, new scenarios. The mental load accumulates with no off-switch.</p>

            <h2>The "Always On" Problem</h2>

            <p>During my fundraising rounds, I noticed something specific about the stress pattern. Normal work stress has peaks and valleys. You ship a feature, you feel relief. You close a deal, you exhale. Fundraising doesn't have those valleys.</p>

            <p>Every conversation is high-stakes. Every email from an investor could be a yes or a no. You're performing for partners, for associates, for advisors who might make introductions. You can't take a day off because momentum matters. If you go quiet for a week, you lose the thread.</p>

            <p>As an investor, I saw this from the other side. I'd schedule a Monday call with a founder who sounded sharp and prepared. By Friday, the same founder sounded flat, scattered, slower to respond. I could hear the sleep deprivation in their voice. The irony wasn't lost on me: the process of evaluating whether to fund a company was actively degrading the founder's ability to run that company.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Helps During a Raise</h2>

            <p>I can't tell you to stop worrying about your fundraise. That would be useless advice. But I can share what I've seen work for founders who got through raises without burning out.</p>

            <p><strong>Time-box your pitch prep.</strong> Set a hard stop at 9pm. No deck revisions, no investor research, no financial model tweaks after that. Your brain needs at least 2 hours of non-fundraise input before sleep. The deck will still be there in the morning. You'll actually be sharper if you stop.</p>

            <p><strong>Use what I call the Mental Bouncer Technique.</strong> When investor thoughts show up at 2am, treat them like uninvited guests. Acknowledge them, then redirect. The thought "what if the lead investor passes" is not useful at 2am. It's the same thought you had at 2pm, and you already dealt with it. Tell it to come back during business hours.</p>

            <p><strong>Offload before bed.</strong> Keep a notebook by your bed. When the pitch scenarios start running, write them down. All of them. The worst cases, the to-dos, the follow-up emails you can't forget. The act of writing clears the mental clutter. You're telling your brain: this is captured, you can stop holding it.</p>

            <p><strong>Protect your exercise timing.</strong> I noticed that founders who exercised in the morning during a raise slept better than those who worked out in the evening. A morning workout burns off cortisol that accumulated overnight. An evening workout adds adrenaline to a system already running hot from a day of investor meetings.</p>

            <p><strong>Accept the damage budget.</strong> A fundraise will cost you some sleep. That's real. The goal isn't perfect sleep during a raise. The goal is losing 30 to 45 minutes instead of 2 to 3 hours. Small interventions compound: writing out the worry, magnesium before bed, slow breathing exercises. None of them are magic. Together, they keep the damage manageable.</p>

            <h2>The Perspective from the Other Side</h2>

            <p>When I became an investor, I started paying attention to how fundraising affected the founders I worked with. The pattern was clear. The best founders weren't the ones who pushed through on 4 hours of sleep. They were the ones who recognized that their judgment, their pitch delivery, their ability to think on their feet in a partner meeting, all of it depended on rest.</p>

            <p>Sleep isn't the cost of raising capital. It's the infrastructure that lets you raise well. The founders who understood this closed better rounds.</p>

            <p>If you're in the middle of a raise right now, and you're reading this at 2am because you can't sleep, here's what I want you to know: this phase ends. The insomnia is temporary. But the habits you build during this period will stick with you. Build the right ones.</p>
