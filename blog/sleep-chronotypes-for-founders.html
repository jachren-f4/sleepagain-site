          <h1>Sleep Chronotypes for Founders: Lion, Bear, Wolf, or Dolphin?</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 17, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>For years I tried to be a 4:30am founder. I read the interviews. I listened to the podcasts. Every high-performer seemed to wake before dawn, crush a workout, and have three hours of deep work done before the rest of the world opened their laptops. So I set my alarm, forced myself out of bed, and powered through.</p>

            <p>I felt terrible. Not just groggy. Cognitively slow. I would sit down to write or plan and the words wouldn't come. My best thinking happened later in the day, but by then my calendar was full of meetings. It took me years to understand what was going on. I'm a late chronotype. My biology is wired for evening alertness, not dawn productivity.</p>

            <p>Once I stopped fighting that, everything changed. My sleep improved. My mental clarity improved. The guilt faded. But I had to learn the science first.</p>

            <h2>What Are Chronotypes?</h2>

            <p>Your chronotype is your biological preference for when you feel alert and when you feel sleepy. It's not a personality trait or a lifestyle choice. It's determined largely by genetics.</p>

            <p>The PER3 gene is one of the key drivers. People with a longer variant of PER3 tend to be morning types. Those with a shorter variant lean toward evening. Over 350 genetic variants have been identified that influence where you fall on the spectrum. You can shift your schedule with discipline, but you can't rewrite your DNA.</p>

            <p>From an evolutionary perspective, this variation served a purpose. In early human tribes, having people naturally awake at different hours meant someone was always on watch. The morning types covered dawn. The evening types covered the late hours. The group survived because not everyone slept at the same time.</p>

            <p>Roughly 20% of the population are clear morning types, 20% are clear evening types, and the remaining 60% sit somewhere in the middle. Chronotypes also shift across your lifetime. Babies wake at dawn. Teenagers drift strongly toward evening. Most people settle into their adult pattern around age 23 or 24. Then in the mid-50s, the clock shifts earlier again.</p>

            <h2>The Four Types</h2>

            <p><strong>Lion.</strong> The early riser. Lions wake naturally between 5:30 and 6:00am and hit peak mental performance before noon. They do their best deep work in the morning, start fading in the early afternoon, and are ready for bed by 9 or 10pm. If you're the founder who gets more done before lunch than after it, you might be a Lion.</p>

            <p><strong>Bear.</strong> The majority. Bears follow the solar cycle. They wake with the sun, peak in mid-morning, and feel a natural dip after lunch. Most people are Bears. If you function well on a standard schedule and don't feel strongly pulled toward either extreme, this is likely you. Bears do well with a 7am to 11pm rhythm.</p>

            <p><strong>Wolf.</strong> The evening type. Wolves struggle in the early morning and come alive in the late afternoon and evening. Creative work tends to peak after 4pm. If you've ever noticed that your best ideas come at 9pm or that you do your clearest thinking when the office is empty, you're probably a Wolf. This was me.</p>

            <p><strong>Dolphin.</strong> The light sleeper. Dolphins have irregular sleep patterns and are often anxious sleepers. Their alertness peaks vary from day to day. Many entrepreneurs with racing minds fall into this category. Dolphins tend to do well with shorter, focused work blocks rather than long stretches, and they benefit the most from structured wind-down routines.</p>

            <p>These categories aren't rigid. You might sit between two types or shift slightly depending on the season or what's happening in your life. But most people recognize themselves clearly in one of the four.</p>

            <h2>Why It Matters for Founders</h2>

            <p>A University of Minnesota study tracked students whose school start times were pushed one hour later. Their grades improved by a full letter grade. Not because they studied more. Because their brains were finally operating during their natural window of peak performance.</p>

            <p>A larger study, known as the Synchrony Effect, tested 800 students and found the same pattern. When schedules aligned with individual chronotypes, performance improved across the board. Morning types didn't outperform evening types because of higher IQ or more discipline. They outperformed because the system was built around their rhythm. Evening types, forced into an early schedule, were working against their biology every single day.</p>

            <p>As founders, we have an advantage most people don't. We can design our own schedules. Nobody is forcing us to start at 8am or end at 5pm. But that advantage is useless if we don't know what we're designing around. If you're a Wolf running a Lion's schedule, you're leaving cognitive performance on the table every morning.</p>

            <h2>Designing Your Day Around Your Type</h2>

            <p>When I accepted that I was an evening type, I restructured my day. I moved deep work, writing, strategy, and anything requiring creative thought, to late morning and early afternoon. I pushed meetings and calls to the mid-afternoon slot when my energy for focused thinking drops anyway. I stopped scheduling important decisions before 10am.</p>

            <p>The shift was maybe 90 minutes in either direction. That's it. But it changed the quality of nearly every working hour. I wasn't fighting myself anymore. I was working with my biology instead of against it.</p>

            <p>You can do the same thing. Identify your peak alertness window by paying attention to when you feel sharpest over the course of a week. Then protect that window. Schedule your most demanding cognitive work there. Move the administrative and routine tasks to your lower-energy periods. If you're a Lion, do your deep thinking before lunch and take meetings in the afternoon. If you're a Wolf, stop trying to do creative work at 7am and give yourself permission to peak later.</p>

            <h2>Your Chronotype Is Not a Problem to Solve</h2>

            <p>The founder who wakes at 5am isn't more disciplined than the one who wakes at 8am. They're biologically different. One isn't better. The system has historically rewarded early risers because schools and workplaces were built for them. That doesn't make it optimal for everyone.</p>

            <p>Your chronotype is not something to overcome. It's something to design around. The founder who understands their biology and builds their schedule accordingly has an edge over the one who spends years fighting it. I know because I spent those years fighting. The day I stopped was the day my sleep started getting better.</p>
