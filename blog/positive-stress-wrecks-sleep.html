          <h1>Positive Stress Wrecks Sleep Too</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 15, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>Everyone knows that anxiety keeps you awake. Financial uncertainty, a collapsing runway, a co-founder breakup. These are the obvious sleep killers. Founders talk about them openly. But there's another category of sleeplessness that almost nobody addresses, because it doesn't feel like a problem.</p>

            <p>Excitement.</p>

            <p>I've had some of the worst nights of my life after the best days. A term sheet signed. A product launch that exceeded projections. An investor meeting where everything clicked. I'd come home buzzing, lie down, and then stare at the ceiling for 3 hours while my brain ran victory laps.</p>

            <h2>Your Body Doesn't Know the Difference</h2>

            <p>Researchers call positive stress "eustress." It's the kind of activation you feel when something good is happening. A funding round closing. A major customer saying yes. Your app hitting the top charts. It feels great. And it wrecks your sleep just as effectively as dread.</p>

            <p>The reason is biological. Excitement triggers cortisol and adrenaline. The same hormones that spike when you're worried about running out of money also spike when you close a deal that secures your next 18 months. Your nervous system doesn't distinguish between good arousal and bad arousal. It just registers: something important is happening, stay alert.</p>

            <p>Cortisol suppresses melatonin. Adrenaline raises your heart rate. Your brain shifts into planning mode, running forward through all the possibilities that just opened up. This is the exact opposite of what your body needs to fall asleep.</p>

            <h2>The Night Before a Launch</h2>

            <p>One of the worst patterns I noticed over 15 years of building companies was launch-night insomnia. The night before a big release, or the night right after, was almost guaranteed to be a short one.</p>

            <p>It wasn't worry. The product was ready. The team had done the work. But my mind wouldn't stop. I'd think about what comes next. How users would react. What metrics to watch first thing in the morning. Each thought generated two more thoughts. By 2am, I'd given up trying to sleep and started drafting emails.</p>

            <p>I talked to a founder who described the same thing after closing a contract that would have otherwise forced layoffs of 90% of the team. The relief and excitement were enormous. He expected to sleep well that night. Instead, he lay awake until 4am, replaying the meeting, planning next steps, feeling the adrenaline of survival.</p>

            <h2>Why Founders Don't Address It</h2>

            <p>When you can't sleep because you're stressed about money, you know something is wrong. You might journal, meditate, or talk to someone. The negative emotion signals a problem, and your instinct is to fix it.</p>

            <p>Excitement doesn't trigger that response. You feel good. Why would you fix something that feels good? So you don't take any countermeasures. You skip the wind-down routine because you're riding high. You stay up late texting your co-founder about the win. You check metrics one more time at midnight, just because it feels rewarding.</p>

            <p>This is the trap. Positive stress is invisible stress. It bypasses all the alarm systems that negative stress activates. And because founders are wired to chase these highs, the good days can be just as destructive to sleep as the bad ones.</p>

            <h2>The Founder Who Stopped Celebrating at Night</h2>

            <p>One founder I know described his early career as a cycle of extremes. He celebrated every win and felt dejected after every setback. Both states kept him awake. It took him years to learn to flatten the curve. Not to stop caring, but to stop letting the emotional amplitude dictate his evenings.</p>

            <p>I had to learn the same lesson. In my thirties, I'd get a good piece of news at 6pm and ride the energy all evening. I'd be mentally composing strategy documents at 11pm, not because I was anxious, but because I was excited. My Oura ring data from those nights told a clear story: elevated resting heart rate, reduced deep sleep, and 45 to 60 fewer minutes of total sleep.</p>

            <p>The numbers were identical to my bad-stress nights. My body couldn't tell the difference, even though my mind could.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Works</h2>

            <p>The fix is counterintuitive. You need to apply the same wind-down protocol on your best days as you do on your worst days.</p>

            <p>This means treating the routine as non-negotiable, regardless of mood. On a day where everything went right, you still dim the lights at the same time. You still put the phone away. You still do the same breathing or journaling sequence. The routine is not a response to how you feel. It's a signal to your nervous system that the day is over.</p>

            <p>Here's what I do now:</p>

            <p><strong>Process the energy physically.</strong> If I've had a high-adrenaline day, whether positive or negative, I go for a 20-minute walk after dinner. Not a workout. Just movement. Walking metabolizes cortisol and adrenaline faster than sitting on the couch replaying the day.</p>

            <p><strong>Write it down, then close the notebook.</strong> I spend 10 minutes journaling about the win. What happened, what it means, what comes next. Then I close the notebook. This gives the brain a sense of completion. The thoughts have been captured. They don't need to keep circulating.</p>

            <p><strong>Use the Mental Bouncer.</strong> Most founders know this technique for anxious thoughts. You imagine a bouncer at the door of your mind, turning away unwanted thoughts. What people don't realize is that it works for excited thoughts too. When my brain starts drafting tomorrow's strategy at midnight, the bouncer steps in. "Not now. Come back at 8am." The thought gets acknowledged and redirected, not suppressed.</p>

            <p><strong>Same routine, every night.</strong> The biggest mistake is making your wind-down conditional on your emotional state. If you only do it when you're stressed, you're leaving yourself exposed on the good days. I follow the same 45-minute sequence whether I just lost a client or landed the biggest deal of the year.</p>

            <h2>The Reframe</h2>

            <p>I used to think that not being able to sleep after a great day was a minor inconvenience. Now I see it differently. Those lost hours compound. Three nights of excitement-driven insomnia cost the same amount of deep sleep and cognitive sharpness as three nights of anxiety-driven insomnia. The origin of the arousal is irrelevant to your body.</p>

            <p>If you're a founder who sleeps fine during quiet periods but poorly during both the highs and the lows, this is probably the pattern. The solution isn't to stop getting excited. It's to build a system that protects your sleep regardless of what kind of day you had.</p>

            <p>Your best work tomorrow depends on sleeping well tonight. That's true after a disaster. And it's equally true after a triumph.</p>
