          <h1>Caffeine, Alcohol, and the Founder's Diet</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 11, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>Sleep and food are tightly connected. Most founders I know have optimized their calendar, their task management system, their hiring pipeline. But they haven't looked at what they eat and drink through the lens of sleep. They're fighting their own biology without realizing it.</p>

            <p>The relationship between nutrition and sleep isn't abstract. Caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and meal timing all have direct, measurable effects on your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. If you understand the mechanisms, you can make small adjustments that produce real improvements. If you don't, you end up lying awake wondering why you're still wired at midnight.</p>

            <p>This isn't about becoming a monk. It's about understanding the inputs so you can make informed trade-offs.</p>

            <h2>Caffeine and the Founder Brain</h2>

            <p>Caffeine feels sacred in founder culture. The morning espresso. The afternoon cold brew. The late-night coding sessions fueled by a third cup. I get it. I relied on caffeine for years without questioning the timing or the quantity.</p>

            <p>Here's what actually happens. Throughout the day, your brain accumulates a chemical called adenosine. Adenosine is the sleep pressure signal. The more it builds up, the sleepier you feel. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors. Think of it as a molecular key that jams the lock. The adenosine is still there, building up, but your brain can't detect it. When the caffeine wears off, all that accumulated pressure hits at once.</p>

            <p>The half-life of caffeine is 5 to 6 hours. That means if you drink a cup at 3pm, half the caffeine is still circulating in your system at 9pm. A quarter is still there at midnight. Your body is trying to sleep while caffeine is still jamming the lock.</p>

            <p>I keep it simple now. One cup with breakfast, one after lunch. I cut off all caffeine by 2pm. I also wait about 90 minutes after waking before the first cup. When you wake up, your cortisol is already elevated naturally. Drinking coffee immediately just stacks stimulants on top of each other and leads to a harder crash later. Let your body's own system do the initial work, then add caffeine when cortisol starts to dip.</p>

            <p>One more thing. Before that first cup, drink a full glass of water. Sleep is dehydrative. You lose nearly a liter of water overnight through breathing and perspiration. Starting the day with coffee before water means you're dehydrating a body that's already in deficit.</p>

            <h2>Alcohol: The Nightcap That Backfires</h2>

            <p>During high-stress periods, especially when closing financing rounds, I sometimes reached for whiskey in the evening. It felt like winding down. The tension in my shoulders would ease. My racing thoughts would slow. It seemed like the right move.</p>

            <p>It wasn't. Alcohol is one of the most potent sleep disruptors you can put in your body. It sedates you, which is not the same as helping you sleep. Sedation bypasses the natural sleep architecture your brain needs to restore itself. Alcohol suppresses REM sleep, which is the phase where your brain processes emotions and consolidates learning. It fragments deep sleep. And it creates a rebound effect in the second half of the night, where your body metabolizes the alcohol and you wake up at 2 or 3am with a racing heart.</p>

            <p>There's another layer that matters for founders specifically. During deep sleep, your brain runs a waste clearance system called the glymphatic system. It flushes out metabolic byproducts, including proteins linked to cognitive decline. Alcohol reduces the effectiveness of this process. You're not just losing sleep quality. You're reducing your brain's ability to clean house.</p>

            <p>I haven't eliminated alcohol entirely. But I follow a harm reduction protocol. Alternate each drink with a full glass of water. Stop drinking at least 3 hours before bed. And before sleep, have a glass of coconut water to replenish the minerals and electrolytes that alcohol depletes. These three rules don't make alcohol harmless. They reduce the damage.</p>

            <h2>Sugar Before Bed</h2>

            <p>High sugar intake in the evening raises blood glucose rapidly. That spike triggers an insulin response that interferes with melatonin production. Melatonin is the hormone that signals your brain to transition into sleep. When you eat a bowl of ice cream at 9pm, you're chemically delaying your own sleep onset.</p>

            <p>There's a heart rate component too. Processing a glucose spike elevates your resting heart rate to 75 to 80 BPM for 2 to 3 hours. Your body needs to be cooling down and slowing down to initiate sleep. A sugar spike keeps your cardiovascular system running hotter and harder during the exact window when it should be winding down.</p>

            <p>I finish eating by 5:30pm most nights. After dinner, I brush my teeth. That's a deliberate signal. Once the teeth are brushed, the kitchen is closed. It's a simple boundary that removes the temptation of late-night snacking. Sugar isn't the enemy. Timing and context are what matter.</p>

            <h2>Meal Timing</h2>

            <p>The standard advice is to finish eating 3 hours before bed. That's decent. Four hours is better. Five is best. My best sleep consistently happens when my last bite is at 5:30pm and I'm asleep by 10:30pm. That gives my body a full 5-hour buffer to complete digestion before sleep begins.</p>

            <p>When you eat late, your body has to prioritize digestion over sleep. Core body temperature rises from the metabolic work. Melatonin production is delayed. Your digestive system is active when it should be dormant. The result is lighter sleep, more awakenings, and less time in the deep sleep stages that actually restore you.</p>

            <p>For founders who travel frequently, this becomes a trap. Business dinners start at 8pm. Conference networking events revolve around late meals. You land in a new time zone and your meal schedule shifts by 3 hours. Each of these disruptions cascades into your sleep. If you can't control when dinner happens, at least eat lighter. A large steak at 9pm is a different metabolic event than a salad at 9pm.</p>

            <h2>The Goal Isn't Elimination</h2>

            <p>Every founder has a relationship with caffeine, food, and probably alcohol. The goal isn't to eliminate any of them. It's to understand how these inputs affect your sleep and adjust the timing accordingly.</p>

            <p>Move your caffeine cutoff to 2pm. Build a 3-hour buffer between your last drink and bedtime. Finish eating earlier. Hydrate before you caffeinate. These are small changes. They don't require willpower or discipline. They require understanding the mechanism and then shifting the schedule by an hour or two. The compounding effect on sleep quality is significant.</p>
