          <h1>The $80 Billion Sleep Industry Doesn't Want You to Know This</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 17, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>The global sleep industry is worth over $80 billion. That number covers everything from weighted blankets and smart mattresses to melatonin gummies and sleep-tracking rings. Every year, the market grows. Every year, people sleep worse.</p>

            <p>I spent years buying into it. As a founder, I'm wired to optimize. If there's a product that promises better sleep, I want to test it. I bought the gadgets. I tracked every metric. I spent 3,000 euros on a temperature-controlled mattress. And what I eventually learned is that the things that actually fixed my sleep cost almost nothing.</p>

            <h2>The $3,000 Mattress Experiment</h2>

            <p>I'd been fantasizing about an Eight Sleep for years. It's a mattress cover that pumps water at different temperatures throughout the night. Cool for falling asleep, warm for REM cycles. The science behind it is real. Your core body temperature drops when you prepare for sleep, and a cooler environment helps that process along.</p>

            <p>The first night was rough. The bed warmed up too aggressively during the night and I kept waking up. I adjusted the settings. The second night was better. Deep sleep and REM numbers improved. Then I started getting muscle cramps in my calves from the cold. I adjusted again. I started wearing woolen socks to bed with my smart mattress. A friend was launching into laugh attacks on our calls when I described the setup.</p>

            <p>After a few weeks, my sleep numbers returned to exactly where they'd been with a regular bed. The novelty wore off. The improvements vanished. I used the 30-day money-back guarantee and went back to my IKEA bed.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, a $20 pair of blackout curtains and a $15 pack of earplugs were doing more for my sleep than the smart mattress ever did.</p>

            <h2>Sleep Trackers and the Anxiety They Create</h2>

            <p>There's a clinical term for this: orthosomnia. It's when tracking your sleep actually makes your sleep worse. You check your sleep score in the morning. You got a 72. Now you're anxious about tonight. You go to bed thinking about the number instead of just going to bed.</p>

            <p>I've been tracking my sleep with an Apple Watch for over 16 months. The data has been useful exactly twice. Once when I noticed heavy upper-body workouts were compressing my light sleep phases. And once when a new medication disrupted my resting heart rate for two months. Those were genuine patterns I wouldn't have caught without tracking.</p>

            <p>But the nightly score? That became noise. For most people, the tracker confirms what you already know. If you feel tired, you slept poorly. If you feel rested, you slept well. You don't need a $300 ring to tell you that.</p>

            <p>Use tracking for monthly trends and pattern detection. Ignore the daily number. If checking your sleep score is the first thing you do every morning, the tracker is hurting more than it's helping.</p>

            <h2>The Supplement Problem</h2>

            <p>Melatonin is the most popular sleep supplement in the world. Most people use it wrong. Your body already produces melatonin naturally when it gets dark. Taking a supplement doesn't add to your supply. It replaces what your brain would make on its own. Over time, your body can reduce its natural production because the external source is handling it.</p>

            <p>If you're taking melatonin every night, you're not fixing a sleep problem. You're creating a dependency that masks one.</p>

            <p>The one supplement with consistent research behind it is magnesium. Magnesium glycinate or threonate, specifically. It supports muscle relaxation and may help with sleep onset. It's not dramatic. You won't feel sedated. But it's one of the few supplements where the evidence actually holds up.</p>

            <p>Everything else, the fancy sleep teas, the CBD gummies, the adaptogenic blends, is mostly marketing. The placebo effect is real. The ingredients, less so.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Moves the Needle</h2>

            <p>After testing dozens of products and spending thousands of euros, here's what I actually use every night: blackout curtains, earplugs, and a room temperature around 18 degrees Celsius. Total cost: under $50.</p>

            <p>Darkness matters because even small light sources, a standby LED or light creeping through blinds, can suppress melatonin production. Your brain registers light through your eyelids. Total darkness isn't a preference. It's a biological requirement for deep sleep.</p>

            <p>Earplugs matter because your brain stays partially alert during the night, listening for threats. A car alarm, a snowplow at 5am, your kids in the hallway. Each noise can pull you out of deep sleep into a lighter stage without you even noticing. You wake up tired after 8 hours and don't know why. Earplugs fix that.</p>

            <p>Temperature matters because your body needs to cool down to initiate sleep. Around 18 degrees Celsius works for most people. You don't need a water-cooled mattress to get there. Open a window. Use a fan pointed away from you. Start with a light blanket and pull it over later when your body naturally reheats around 2 or 3am.</p>

            <h2>The Founder Trap</h2>

            <p>Entrepreneurs are the sleep industry's ideal customers. We love optimization. We love tools. We love solving problems with purchases. A $300 tracker, a $2,000 mattress, a $50 monthly supplement stack. It feels productive. It feels like progress.</p>

            <p>But sleep isn't an engineering problem. You can't buy your way to 8 hours. The fundamentals are free: a consistent bedtime, a dark room, managing stress, not checking email at 11pm. These aren't exciting. They don't come in premium packaging. But they work.</p>

            <p>I'm not anti-technology. My Apple Watch tracks useful monthly trends. A good air purifier costs $25 and quietly filters the room I spend 8 hours in every night. Some tools earn their place. But the ROI curve flattens fast. The first $50 of sleep improvements gives you 80% of the results. Everything after that is marginal at best.</p>

            <h2>The Real Secret</h2>

            <p>The sleep industry doesn't want you to know that the most effective sleep tools are boring and cheap. Blackout curtains. Earplugs. A cool room. A consistent schedule. No phone in the bedroom.</p>

            <p>None of these have a subscription model. None of them need firmware updates. None of them generate recurring revenue for a VC-backed startup. That's why you don't see them in your Instagram ads.</p>

            <p>Save your money. Fix the basics. Then, if you still want to experiment, at least you'll know the expensive stuff is incremental, not foundational.</p>
