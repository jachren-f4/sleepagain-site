          <h1>If You Liked Why We Sleep, Read This Next</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 11, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>I read <em>Why We Sleep</em> in 2019. At the time, I was running a gaming studio and sleeping maybe 5 hours a night. Matthew Walker's book changed how I thought about what I was doing to myself. The data on cognitive decline, immune function, and long-term health risks was impossible to ignore.</p>

            <p>I finished the book convinced that sleep was the single most important thing I was neglecting. And then I lay awake that night thinking about all the ways I was ruining my health.</p>

            <p>That's the paradox of <em>Why We Sleep</em>. It's a brilliant book. It will make you take sleep seriously. But it won't necessarily help you sleep. Especially if you're a founder.</p>

            <h2>The Knowledge Gap</h2>

            <p>After reading Walker's book, I knew exactly why sleep mattered. I understood REM cycles, glymphatic clearance, the relationship between sleep deprivation and Alzheimer's risk. I had the science down.</p>

            <p>None of that stopped me from waking up at 3am thinking about runway.</p>

            <p>The problem wasn't motivation. I was motivated. I wanted to sleep. The problem was that knowing why sleep matters and knowing how to sleep when your brain is running investor scenarios are two completely different skills. Walker gave me the first one. I had to figure out the second one myself.</p>

            <p>That process took years. I tested dozens of strategies, tracked data, talked to other founders, read the research. Eventually, I built a system that worked. That system became <em>Sleep Again</em>.</p>

            <h2>Where Walker Leaves Off</h2>

            <p><em>Why We Sleep</em> ends with general sleep hygiene recommendations. Avoid caffeine after a certain hour. Keep the room cool. Maintain a consistent schedule. This is solid advice. It's also the same advice you'll find on any sleep clinic website.</p>

            <p>What Walker doesn't cover is the founder-specific layer. He doesn't address what happens when you're three months into a fundraise and your cortisol is elevated 16 hours a day. He doesn't talk about the overtraining trap, where founders push too hard at the gym trying to tire themselves out, and end up with worse sleep because their nervous system is constantly in overdrive. He doesn't discuss the guilt loop of lying in bed knowing your competitor is probably still working.</p>

            <p>These aren't niche problems. In my conversations with dozens of founders, they came up in nearly every single one.</p>

            <h2>What I Built on Top of the Science</h2>

            <p><em>Sleep Again</em> takes the science that Walker laid out and applies it to the specific challenges of building companies. Here's what that looks like in practice.</p>

            <p>The Mental Bouncer Technique is a method I developed for the 3am wake-up. When your brain starts looping through tomorrow's problems, you need a concrete protocol for redirecting it. Not a breathing exercise. A specific cognitive strategy that works when your mind is already revved up. I tested variations of this for over a year before landing on the version in the book.</p>

            <p>The overtraining chapter covers something I've never seen in another sleep book. Founders who exercise intensely in the evening often wake up between 3am and 5am with an elevated heart rate. The mechanism is straightforward: late high-intensity training raises core body temperature and cortisol at exactly the wrong time. I lay out the specific timing and intensity adjustments that fixed this for me and for several founders I interviewed.</p>

            <p>The fundraising insomnia chapter addresses the single worst sleep period most founders will face. I break down why fundraising creates a unique cortisol pattern and what you can do about it when you can't simply reduce your stress level.</p>

            <p>The $50 sleep toolkit is the result of testing dozens of products over several years. Blackout curtains, earplugs, a specific type of sleep mask, and a few other items. No expensive gadgets. Just the things that actually moved the needle for under $50 total.</p>

            <h2>The Founder's Brain at Night</h2>

            <p>Walker explains that sleep deprivation impairs the prefrontal cortex, the brain region responsible for judgment and impulse control. This is critical information for founders. But the book doesn't address the reverse problem: that the founder's waking habits impair sleep.</p>

            <p>When you spend 12 hours a day making high-stakes decisions, your brain doesn't downshift at 10pm just because you turned off the lights. The neural pathways you've been firing all day stay active. Your brain keeps problem-solving because that's what it's been trained to do.</p>

            <p>I wrote an entire chapter on wind-down routines specifically for this. Not generic advice about dimming the lights. Specific strategies for transitioning out of decision-making mode when your default state is always on.</p>

            <h2>Complementary, Not Competitive</h2>

            <p>I want to be clear about something. <em>Why We Sleep</em> is an important book. I reference Walker's research multiple times in <em>Sleep Again</em>. The scientific foundation he built is part of what makes the practical strategies work. When you understand why your glymphatic system needs deep sleep to clear metabolic waste from your brain, you're more likely to protect that sleep window.</p>

            <p>The two books serve different functions. Walker gives you the conviction. <em>Sleep Again</em> gives you the tools. If you've already read <em>Why We Sleep</em> and you're still struggling, the gap isn't knowledge. It's application.</p>

            <p>That's what I wrote <em>Sleep Again</em> to fill.</p>

            <h2>Who Should Read It</h2>

            <p>If you read <em>Why We Sleep</em> and thought "I know all this, but I still can't sleep," <em>Sleep Again</em> is the next step. It's written for founders, startup operators, and anyone in a high-pressure role where the standard advice falls short.</p>

            <p>The book is 27 chapters, 54,000 words, and 87 endnotes. It covers sleep science, lifestyle factors, mental strategies, and a practical toolkit. I wrote it in first person because this is a problem I lived with for years, and the solutions came from testing, not from theory.</p>

            <p>Walker taught me why sleep matters. Then I had to learn how to actually get it.</p>
