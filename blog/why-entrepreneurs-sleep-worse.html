          <h1>Why Entrepreneurs Sleep Worse Than Everyone Else</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 17, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>I was a VC-backed founder for 15 years, then an investor for 6 years. During that time, I had hundreds of catch-up calls with founders. We talked about hiring, pitch decks, product strategy, and fundraising. Sleep almost never came up.</p>

            <p>It wasn't that sleep didn't matter. It was that everyone treated it like background noise. The founders I worked with were pulling 12 to 16 hour days. Their thoughts about the company didn't shut down when the workday ended. But nobody talked about it. Sleep was the invisible tax on building something from nothing.</p>

            <p>When I finally asked a dozen founders about their relationship with sleep, the answers were strikingly similar. Almost every one of them pointed to the same triggers. Not screen time. Not caffeine. The real problems were structural, baked into the nature of entrepreneurship itself.</p>

            <h2>The Fundraising Spiral</h2>

            <p>Fundraising came up again and again as the single worst sleep period. One founder described going to bed thinking about the raise, upcoming meetings, and pitch strategies, then waking up with those same thoughts still running. Her brain would cycle through every scenario, lingering on the worst ones.</p>

            <p>Another founder reported sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a night during a critical funding round. He would fall asleep quickly but wake around 2am and couldn't get back down. After three months of this, he started medication. The pattern eventually led to burnout and a month of medical leave.</p>

            <p>The mechanism is straightforward. Financial uncertainty triggers cortisol. Cortisol keeps the brain alert. The brain cycles through scenarios because that's what it's designed to do under threat. In evolutionary terms, your brain doesn't know the difference between a predator and a collapsing runway. It responds to both the same way: stay awake, stay ready.</p>

            <h2>Decision Fatigue After Dark</h2>

            <p>Founders make hundreds of micro-decisions every day. Which feature to prioritize. Whether to hire or wait. How to respond to an investor email. Each decision draws from the same cognitive reserve.</p>

            <p>By evening, that reserve is depleted. But the mind doesn't stop. It shifts from making decisions to replaying them. Did I send the right message? Should I have pushed back harder? What if we run out of money in four months?</p>

            <p>This is different from the stress a salaried employee might feel. When you own the outcome, every decision feels existential. The company's survival is tied to your judgment. That weight doesn't lift when you close the laptop.</p>

            <h2>The Hustle Culture Trap</h2>

            <p>There's a persistent narrative in startup culture that sleep is a luxury. You hear it in podcast interviews, on X, in investor presentations. The founder who sleeps 4 hours gets celebrated. The one who prioritizes rest gets questioned.</p>

            <p>I bought into this for years. I thought I could function on 5 hours. In some ways, I could. I'd get through the day, handle meetings, write emails. But I was running on autopilot. Creativity wasn't coming to the surface. I had more friction in relationships. I was less open-minded in meetings, quicker to dismiss other people's points.</p>

            <p>The irony is that the qualities founders need most, creative thinking, emotional regulation, and sound judgment, are the first things to erode with poor sleep. You can push through task execution on 5 hours. You can't innovate on it.</p>

            <h2>The Guilt Loop</h2>

            <p>Entrepreneurs carry a unique form of guilt around sleep. If you're lying in bed, you're not working. If you're not working, someone else is outpacing you. This creates an anxiety loop that makes sleep itself harder.</p>

            <p>One founder I interviewed described it well. He said his relationship with sleep is a hit or miss. During the week, he struggles to compartmentalize the issues. He's always calculating runway, recalculating financial models, fighting the doubt that comes from his own predictions.</p>

            <p>The guilt doesn't just prevent you from getting to bed. It follows you into bed. It turns rest into a performance metric. And when you start measuring sleep as something you need to optimize, you sometimes end up in a worse place than where you started.</p>

            <h2>The Travel Factor</h2>

            <p>Founders travel more than most professionals. Investor meetings, conferences, client visits, team offsites. Each trip disrupts your circadian rhythm, which is the internal clock that governs when you feel alert and when you feel sleepy.</p>

            <p>I once flew from Helsinki to New York for a week of back-to-back investor meetings. I tried to stay productive by working late and waking early. By day 3, I felt off mentally and physically. Digestion was off, sleep came in fragments, and I was getting irritable. It wasn't just stress. It was a circadian breakdown.</p>

            <p>You don't even need to fly to experience this. If you're running a distributed team across time zones, taking calls at 6am and then again at 11pm, you're creating the same disruption from your home office.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Helps</h2>

            <p>The founders I spoke to who had improved their sleep all said some version of the same thing. They stopped treating sleep as an obstacle and started treating it as infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The specific strategies vary. Some shifted their workout timing. Some built strict wind-down routines. Some learned to stop checking email after 7pm. But the mindset shift was the same: sleep isn't the cost of building a company. It's the foundation that lets you build well.</p>

            <p>I wrote an entire book about this because I couldn't find one that addressed what founders actually face. The generic advice, avoid blue light, cut caffeine, is fine. But it misses the real problem. When your mind won't stop because the company depends on you, you need tools built for that specific challenge.</p>
