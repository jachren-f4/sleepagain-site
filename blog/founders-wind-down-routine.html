          <h1>The Founder's Wind-Down Routine: How to Actually Switch Off</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 25, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>For most of my career as a founder, I didn't have a wind-down routine. I'd watch TV, play video games, eat whatever I wanted, and do it all right up until it was time to brush my teeth and get into bed. Some nights I slept fine. Other nights I'd lie awake for an hour, staring at the ceiling, replaying the day's decisions. I assumed the bad nights were random.</p>

            <p>They weren't. What I was doing in the two hours before bed was directly shaping whether I'd fall asleep or not. It took me years to figure that out.</p>

            <h2>Why Generic Advice Falls Short</h2>

            <p>You've heard the standard wind-down advice. Put your phone down. Avoid blue light. Drink chamomile tea. It's not wrong, but it misses the real problem for founders.</p>

            <p>The real problem isn't your phone. It's your brain. After 12 to 14 hours of making decisions, solving problems, and carrying the weight of a company on your shoulders, your mind doesn't just stop because you closed the laptop. It keeps running. Runway calculations. That difficult conversation with a co-founder. The feature you're not sure about. The investor email you haven't responded to.</p>

            <p>Your brain stays in work mode well into the evening. Telling it to relax is like telling a jet engine to be quiet. You need a deliberate process to power it down.</p>

            <h2>The Transition Period</h2>

            <p>Think of your shift from work to sleep like landing a plane. You can't go from cruising altitude to the runway in 30 seconds. You need a gradual descent.</p>

            <p>For founders, I've found that a 2 to 3 hour buffer works best. Stop working at least 2 hours before bed. Then start your actual wind-down routine about 60 to 90 minutes before your target bedtime. This gives your brain two distinct transition phases: first from work to leisure, then from leisure to sleep.</p>

            <p>I used to think this was excessive. I thought I could work until 10pm and fall asleep at 10:30. In my twenties, I could sometimes pull it off. By my forties, it was impossible. The later I worked, the longer I'd lie awake. The correlation was clear once I started tracking it.</p>

            <h2>The Couch-Sleeping Trap</h2>

            <p>This one caught me off guard. I'd be on the couch watching something, my eyelids getting heavy, starting to drift off. Then I'd "wake up," drag myself to the bathroom, brush my teeth, check my phone, and get into bed. Wide awake.</p>

            <p>The reason is physical. Standing up, walking to the bedroom, and climbing into bed raises your heart rate above the relaxed state your body needs for sleep onset. Your body was ready for sleep on the couch, but moving around reset the system.</p>

            <p>Now when I catch myself dozing on the couch, I treat it as a signal. I go straight to bed. Don't brush your teeth, don't check your phone. Just go. The teeth can wait until morning. That window of sleepiness is precious, and once it closes, you might be awake for another hour waiting for the next one.</p>

            <h2>Building Your Protocol</h2>

            <p>Here's what my wind-down routine looks like now. I built it piece by piece over about six months. I didn't start with all of this. I added one element at a time and kept what worked.</p>

            <p><strong>Hard stop on work.</strong> Laptop closes at 8pm. No exceptions. I used to make exceptions for "quick" emails. Those quick emails would trigger 45 minutes of mental processing. Now the laptop goes into a different room after 8.</p>

            <p><strong>Dim the lights.</strong> Around 8:30, I switch from overhead lights to lamps. This isn't just about ambiance. It triggers your body's natural melatonin production. Bright overhead light tells your brain it's still daytime. Dim light from a side lamp tells it the day is ending.</p>

            <p><strong>Brain dump.</strong> I keep a notebook by the couch. Before I settle into anything for the evening, I spend 5 minutes writing down whatever is on my mind. Tomorrow's tasks, unresolved problems, ideas I don't want to forget. Think of it as downloading your mental tabs before closing the browser for the night. Once it's on paper, the brain relaxes its grip on it.</p>

            <p><strong>Half-speed living.</strong> This one sounds strange, but it works. In the last 2 to 3 hours before bed, I do everything at half pace. I walk slower. I pick things up slower. I brush my teeth slower. The effect is real. So often we go to bed still buzzing from the pace of everything we were doing right up until we got under the covers. Deliberately slowing down your physical movements sends a signal to your nervous system that the urgent part of the day is over.</p>

            <p><strong>Low-stimulation activities.</strong> I read physical books, listen to audiobooks, or have a calm conversation. No work topics. Nothing that requires problem-solving. The activity shouldn't be challenging or goal-oriented. It's about unwinding, not achieving.</p>

            <h2>The 4-7-8 Breathing Technique</h2>

            <p>Once I'm in bed, I use a breathing technique that has become non-negotiable for me. It's called 4-7-8 breathing. Inhale through your nose for 4 counts. Hold for 7 counts. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 counts.</p>

            <p>Do this for 4 to 6 cycles. The long exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which is the branch that controls rest and recovery. It's a bridge between your conscious mind and the part of your nervous system that handles sleep. You're manually flipping the switch from alert to calm.</p>

            <p>I was skeptical when I first tried it. It felt too simple. But after two weeks of doing it consistently, I noticed I was falling asleep faster. Not dramatically, but measurably. 10 to 15 minutes instead of 30 to 40.</p>

            <h2>Consistency Over Perfection</h2>

            <p>The single most important thing about a wind-down routine isn't what you do. It's that you do it consistently.</p>

            <p>Your body thrives on routine. When you do the same sequence of activities before bed every night, your brain starts associating those activities with sleep. After a few weeks, dimming the lights and opening a book become automatic signals that it's time to power down. Your body begins the process before you're even in bed.</p>

            <p>This applies to weekends too. I know how tempting it is to stay up late on Friday and Saturday. But those late nights create a form of jet lag by Monday. Your internal clock doesn't know it's the weekend. It just knows you broke the pattern.</p>

            <p>You don't need to execute every element perfectly every night. Some evenings the routine gets compressed. Some nights you skip the breathing. That's fine. What matters is that the structure is there, and that more often than not, you follow it. 5 out of 7 nights is better than 0 out of 7.</p>

            <p>I spent 15 years as a founder treating sleep as something that just happened at the end of the day. Now I treat the transition to sleep as deliberately as I treat the transition into a focused work block. The wind-down routine isn't the cost of good sleep. It's the mechanism that makes good sleep possible.</p>
