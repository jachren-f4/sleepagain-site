          <h1>How Sleep Deprivation Destroys Decision-Making</h1>
          <p class="blog-meta">By Joakim Achr&eacute;n &middot; February 23, 2026</p>

          <div class="blog-content">
            <p>In 2016, I made one of the worst hiring decisions of my career. I brought on a senior leader who looked great on paper but was a poor culture fit. Within 4 months, two key team members quit. I spent the next quarter doing damage control instead of shipping product.</p>

            <p>Looking back, I was running on about 5 hours a night during that period. I was deep in a fundraise, managing a product launch, and sleeping badly. I remember sitting in the final interview thinking I just needed to fill the role and move on. That's not how you evaluate someone who will shape your company. That's how you make a decision when your brain is running on fumes.</p>

            <p>I didn't connect these things at the time. I thought I was just unlucky. It took years of research and personal tracking before I understood what was actually happening. Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired. It degrades the specific cognitive functions you need most as a founder.</p>

            <h2>What Happens to Your Brain</h2>

            <p>The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain responsible for judgment, planning, risk assessment, and emotional regulation. It's also the first region to suffer when you don't sleep enough. After one night of poor sleep, activity in the prefrontal cortex drops measurably. After several nights, it operates like a dimmer switch turned halfway down.</p>

            <p>This matters for founders because the prefrontal cortex handles exactly the kind of thinking a CEO does all day. Evaluating a term sheet. Deciding whether to pivot. Reading a room during a board meeting. Choosing between two strong candidates. These aren't routine tasks you can muscle through on autopilot. They require the highest-order thinking your brain can produce.</p>

            <p>When that capacity is reduced, you don't notice it in the moment. You still feel like you're making decisions. You're just making worse ones. Research shows that sleep-deprived people consistently overestimate their own performance. You think you're sharp. The data says otherwise.</p>

            <h2>The Founder's Decision Load</h2>

            <p>Founders make hundreds of micro-decisions every day. Which feature to prioritize. Whether to hire or wait. How to respond to an investor email. How to handle a disagreement with a co-founder. Each decision draws from the same cognitive reserve.</p>

            <p>By evening, that reserve is depleted even on a good day. Add sleep deprivation, and you start each morning with a smaller tank. The decisions you make at 3pm on a Tuesday after two bad nights are not the same quality as the ones you'd make after solid rest. They're faster, more reactive, and less creative.</p>

            <p>I noticed this pattern in myself over years. On weeks where I slept 7 hours consistently, I was more willing to sit with uncertainty. I'd take an extra day before responding to a difficult email. I'd push back on bad terms in a negotiation instead of just wanting to close the deal. On bad sleep weeks, everything felt urgent. I wanted problems resolved immediately, even when patience was the better move.</p>

            <h2>Attention Residue Makes It Worse</h2>

            <p>Founders don't just make a lot of decisions. They task-switch constantly. One hour it's a product review. The next it's a finance call. Then a 1-on-1 with an engineer, then investor follow-ups. Each switch carries what researchers call attention residue, a lingering cognitive load from the previous task that bleeds into the next one.</p>

            <p>Even on a good night's sleep, this constant switching taxes the brain. Add sleep deprivation, and the residue compounds. Your working memory shrinks. You carry more unprocessed information from task to task. The result is that you're not fully present in any single conversation or decision.</p>

            <p>I've sat in meetings after bad nights where I could hear the words being spoken but couldn't track the logic. My mind kept drifting back to an unresolved issue from the morning. The meeting ended, decisions were made, and I later realized I hadn't really engaged with any of them. That's not leadership. That's presence without participation.</p>

            <h2>Emotional Regulation Breaks Down</h2>

            <p>Sleep deprivation doesn't just affect your analytical thinking. It hits your emotional brain hard. The amygdala, which processes emotional responses, becomes more reactive on poor sleep. At the same time, the prefrontal cortex loses its ability to moderate those reactions. You become quicker to anger, more defensive in feedback sessions, and less empathetic with your team.</p>

            <p>I've seen this in myself. After a bad stretch of sleep, small frustrations become big reactions. A missed deadline that I'd normally handle calmly turns into a tense conversation. A co-founder's feedback feels like a personal attack. These emotional misfires erode trust over time, and trust is the single most important currency in a startup.</p>

            <h2>Creativity and Risk Assessment</h2>

            <p>Two of the most valuable founder skills are creative problem-solving and accurate risk assessment. Both depend heavily on sleep.</p>

            <p>During deep sleep and REM, the brain consolidates information and builds new connections between ideas. This is why you sometimes wake up with a solution to a problem you were stuck on the day before. Cut that process short, and you lose the raw material for creative thinking.</p>

            <p>Risk assessment suffers differently. Sleep-deprived people fixate on potential rewards while underweighting potential losses. For a founder evaluating whether to enter a new market or double down on a failing strategy, this bias is dangerous. You take reckless bets and miss the warning signs.</p>

            <h2>What You Can Do About It</h2>

            <p>The fix isn't complicated, but it requires treating sleep as infrastructure rather than a luxury. Here's what shifted things for me.</p>

            <p>I stopped making important decisions after 4pm on bad sleep days. If I'd had a rough night, I'd handle routine work in the afternoon and push judgment-heavy tasks to the next morning. This one rule alone probably saved me from several bad calls.</p>

            <p>I built a hard stop into my evenings. No email, no Slack, no investor updates after 8pm. The inputs that kept my brain in work mode were the same ones degrading my sleep. Cutting them off gave my cortisol time to drop before bed.</p>

            <p>I started tracking which decisions I made on good sleep versus bad sleep. Over a few months, the pattern was clear. The decisions I was proud of came after nights where I'd slept 7 hours or more. The ones I regretted clustered around stretches of 5 hours or less.</p>

            <h2>The Real Competitive Advantage</h2>

            <p>Every founder I know optimizes for speed, execution, and conviction. These are the right instincts. But none of them work if the underlying hardware is degraded. Sleep is the operating system that everything else runs on. When it's compromised, your speed produces errors. Your execution is sloppy. Your conviction is misplaced.</p>

            <p>The founder who sleeps well doesn't have fewer problems. They just process them better. They hold more complexity in their head. They stay calm under pressure. They see the option that the exhausted version of themselves would have missed.</p>

            <p>After 15 years of building companies and 6 years in VC, I can say this with confidence: the single highest-leverage thing a founder can do for decision quality is protect their sleep. Not optimize their calendar. Not read another strategy book. Sleep. Everything downstream improves when you do.</p>
